        A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of <br>
        aerospace engineering and scientific proposals <strong>since the late 1940s.</strong> Plans include landing <br>
        on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos <br>
        and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and starting terraforming of <br> 
        the planet.

            <p class="main_text">
            The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. <br> Conceptual work for missions that would involve human explorers has been ongoing since <br> <strong>the 1950s</strong>, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place anywhere between <br> 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The list of <strong>crewed</strong> Mars mission plans shows <br> the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space <br> agencies in this field of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in <br> which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a <br> few weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization or <br> other continuous humanization). <q>[citation needed]</q> Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic <br> technologies, have also been proposed. <br>
            <em>In the 2010s</em>, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for <br> human missions to Mars. <q>[citation needed]</q> In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration <br> and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films.
