            has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of 
            aerospace engineering and scientific proposals <strong>since the late 1940s.</strong> Plans include landing
            on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos
            and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and starting terraforming of
            the planet.

            <h2 class="main_title">Exploration of Mars</h2>

            <p class="main_text">
            The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. 
            Conceptual work for missions that would involve human explorers has been ongoing since 
            <strong>the 1950s</strong>, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place anywhere between 
            10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The list of <strong>crewed</strong> Mars mission plans shows 
            the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space 
            agencies in this field of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in 
            which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a 
            few weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization or 
            other continuous humanization). <q>[citation needed]</q> Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic 
            technologies, have also been proposed. 
            <br><em>In the 2010s</em>, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for 
            human missions to Mars. <q>[citation needed]</q> In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration 
            and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films.
